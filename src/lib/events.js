// Events data — edit this file to add, remove, or change events. Nothing else needs to change.
//
// To add a new event, copy one of the objects below and fill in the fields.
// Events move from "Upcoming" to "Past" automatically once their `date` has passed —
// you don't need to move them between lists yourself.
//
// Fields:
//   id          — unique short slug, no spaces (used internally, doesn't show on the page)
//   name        — event name
//   date        — the event's date as 'YYYY-MM-DD' (used to sort and to decide upcoming vs past —
//                 always required, even if dateDisplay is set)
//   dateDisplay — (optional) text shown instead of the full date, e.g. 'October 2026' — use this
//                 for private/invite-only events where you don't want the exact date public
//   time        — (optional) display text, e.g. '7:00 PM' — leave out entirely to hide it on the card
//   venue       — (optional) venue name / location — leave out entirely to hide it on the card
//   description — 1–2 sentences
//   ctaLabel    — (optional) button text, e.g. 'RSVP', 'Book', 'Register Interest'
//   ctaUrl      — (optional) where the button links to — leave both ctaLabel and ctaUrl out entirely
//                 to hide the button (e.g. for invite-only events with no public sign-up)
//   image       — (past events only, optional) path to a single photo, e.g. '/events/photo.jpg'
//   images      — (past events only, optional) array of photo paths for a gallery, e.g.
//                 ['/events/1.jpg', '/events/2.jpg'] — put the actual files in the `public/events/` folder
